# 🚴‍♀️ Excel Project 2: Bike Sales Analysis

## 📘 Part 1: Data Preparation & Categorisation

- Created a **Pivot Table** to summarize bike sales:
  - **Grouped by**: County and Product
  - **Analyzed**: Sales volume across regions and product types
- Used the **`SWITCH` function** to categorize products into custom sales categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on their total volume

## 📊 Part 2: Data Visualisation

- Created compelling charts to explore trends and highlight performance:

  ### 🥧 Pie Chart: Revenue by Age Group
  - Showed contribution of each demographic:
    - **Adults (35–64)** – 50% of total revenue
    - **Young Adults (25–34)** – 36%
    - **Youth (<25)** – 14%
    - **Seniors (64+)** – 0%
  - Visualised customer value across age segments
